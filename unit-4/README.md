## Overview

In this unit, students will work in teams to create a React game of their choosing. This will serve as their capstone project, as it will combine all the React and JavaScript skills they’ve learned throughout the year. 

The hope is that this will be a project students will be able to share about in future internships or even job interviews since it will require teamwork and significant planning. Students will also need to make frequent use of documentation to complete this project as building their game might require concepts that have not been taught in class. 

These projects will be presented in a showcase on the last day of class.
