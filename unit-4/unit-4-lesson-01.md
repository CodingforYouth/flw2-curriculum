## Key Points

- üëã Welcome & Do Now (10) :
    - Start with a quick icebreaker to engage the students and set a positive tone for the session.
    - Encourage students to play the game 2048, prompting them to think about how they might build a similar game. 
    - [Link to Game](https://play2048.co/)
    - This activity aims to stimulate initial thoughts on game development.<br><br>

- üëÄ Project Reveal (15) :
    - Introduce the capstone project concept, emphasizing the use of React to build a game.
    - Show an example game to give students a concrete idea of what they will be working on.
