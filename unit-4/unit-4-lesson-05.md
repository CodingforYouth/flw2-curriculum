## Key Points

- 👋 Welcome & Do Now (10) :
    - Briefly welcome students and introduce the day's objectives.
    - Conduct an icebreaker activity (details to be added by the lead volunteer).
    - Create a short Do Now activity that meets students' needs. (optional)<br><br>

- 🗃️ State Review (15) :
    - Introduce the concept of state in React, explaining it as an object used to store data that influences component behavior. 
    - Highlight the importance of state in dynamic applications.
    - Use simple components (e.g., Location Component, Traffic Signal Component) to illustrate how state is structured and its role in defining component behavior.
    - Encourage students to discuss why state is essential and how it helps describe the application's current condition.
    - Explain how user interactions affect state changes and necessitate component re-renders.
    - Clarify the difference between props and state, emphasizing that props are passed to components and immutable, whereas state is managed within components and mutable.<br><br>

- 💻 Practice with State (20) :
    - Dive deeper into managing local state using the useState hook, explaining syntax, functionality, and usage through examples.
    - Guide students through coding exercises to reinforce their understanding of state management in React. 
    - Consider varying the format based on class size and student preferences (individual vs. group work).<br><br>

- ⏳ Break (10)<br><br>

- 💻 Project Work Time (60) :
    - Start with a team scrum to discuss goals and tasks.
    - Allocate time for coding, with periodic check-ins to reassess progress.
    - Emphasize the use of documentation and online resources for troubleshooting and learning.<br><br>

- 👋 Closing (5) :
    - Direct students to the Exit Ticket in the Class Agenda.
    - Ensure they submit before leaving.<br><br>
