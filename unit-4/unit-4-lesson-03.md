## Key Points

- 👋 Welcome & Do Now (10) :
    - Briefly welcome students and introduce the day's objectives.
    - Conduct an icebreaker activity (details to be added by the lead volunteer).
    - Discuss the Do Now questions concerning the game chess.<br><br>

- 📊 Data Models (10) :
    - Introduce the concept of data models using relatable examples, such as a chess game or a hotel reservation system, to explain how data models organize and represent data.
    - Discuss the difference between data (e.g., the position of pieces in chess) and logic (e.g., the rules of moving pieces in chess).
    - Explain the components of a data model using examples like the hotel reservation and Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
    - Highlight the importance of identifying what data needs to be represented and how.
    - Walk students through creating a simple data model for a new example, such as a Hangman game. 
    - Engage students by asking them to identify the necessary data components (e.g., chosenWord, guesses).<br><br>

- ✍️ Create a Data Model (30) :
    - Students will apply their understanding by creating a data model for their project.
    - Assist students in planning their project work, helping them decide on the data their model will need to include.<br><br>

- ⏳ Break (10)<br><br>

- 💻 Project Work Time (40) :
    - Guide students in setting up their project environment and starting with their data model creation.
    - Students work on their projects independently or in groups. Circulate to provide support, answer questions, and facilitate problem-solving.
    - Conduct brief check-in sessions every 15 minutes to monitor progress, address challenges, and encourage peer collaboration.<br><br>

- 👋 Closing (5) :
    - Invite teams to share their progress, learnings, and any challenges faced.
    - Provide feedback and encouragement.
    - Remind students to submit their project progress.<br><br>
